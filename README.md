# Awesome Deep Learning of Remote Sensing [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
In this project, we will open source some baseline codes for the remote sensing analysis task, such as semantic segmentation, scene classification, object detection, and image captioning, We will also collect some public datasets that can be used for remote sensing image research and analysis.
- [x] Public Remote Sensing Dataset
- [x] Baseline Codes (Semantic Segmentation/Scene Classification/Object Detection/Image Captioning)
- [x] OpenSoure Codes and Papers
- [x] Compitions About Remote Sensing
